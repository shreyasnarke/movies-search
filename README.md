The Calculator App project implemented using React aims to create a fully functional calculator with an intuitive user interface. This app will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced functions like square root and percentage calculations. Users will be able to input numbers and perform operations using a responsive and visually appealing calculator interface, with the results displayed in real-time. With React's component-based architecture, the Calculator App will provide a smooth and interactive user experience, making it a handy tool for mathematical calculations.
